                    <p>Lloyds banking group had a design system tailored for web, including components, typography, and layouts optimised for larger screens. But there was an increasing need to offer the same robust experience on mobile devices.</p>

                    &#x2022;  Single code base so all components need to have correct 1-to-1 mapping, any changes or updates to one brand will automatically apply to all brands.

                     <h4> Platform Research:</h4>
            <p>
                &#x2022; Android and iOS have different native UI patterns, navigation styles, and system conventions (e.g., Material Design vs. Human Interface Guidelines).  
<br>&#x2022; Consistency needs to be balanced with maintaining platform-specific experiences to adhere to user expectations.
            </p>
               
                   <h4> Analysis:</h4>
            <p>
              <h6>   Before building the mobile design system, the existing desktop design system was thoroughly analysed:

<br>&#x2022; <strong>Core Components: </strong>The desktop system featured cards, tables, modals, buttons, and side navigation patterns.
<br>&#x2022;<strong> Visual Hierarchy: </strong>Desktop screens used extensive space for data-heavy components and multi-column layouts.
<br>&#x2022; <strong>Interaction Models: </strong>The desktop relied on hover states, detailed dropdown menus, none of which translated directly to mobile.
           </h6>  </p>
               
                        <h4> Mobile Design System Strategy</h4>
            <p>
                The strategy involved adapting key elements of the desktop design system while optimising for mobile usage patterns:

            </p>
               
                   <h5> Adapting Components</h5>

<h6> 
&#x2022; Creating a design tokens system (colours, typography, spacing) to maintain visual consistency across devices and brands.
<br> &#x2022;  <strong>Buttons & Inputs: Increased size for mobile touch targets.
<br> &#x2022; <strong>Task Views: Transformed tables into scrollable columns with expandable cards for mobile screens.
<br>&#x2022;  <strong>Cards: Simplified information to focus on key data points (task title, priority).

                <h4 class="mb-3">Documentation and Handoff</h4>
                
                  <h6> A detailed guideline was created to document how the desktop components were adapted for mobile, including:
                      <br>&#x2022;  <strong>Component Behavior: How components like buttons, forms, and cards behave differently on mobile, with platform-specific variations.
<br>&#x2022; Spacing and Sizing: </strong>Mobile-friendly spacing rules, ensuring readable text and touchable elements across different screen sizes.
<br>&#x2022; Sketch component libraries was distributed to the teams</h6>

                    <p class="mb-5">Implementing an unified mobile design system addressed critical challenges and resulted in significant improvements in efficiency, consistency, and collaboration. By establishing a single source of truth and creating reusable components, not only enhanced its product development process but also reinforced its brand identity. The design system's scalability ensures continued growth and will adapt to future needs, making it a crucial asset for the company's ongoing success.</p>
